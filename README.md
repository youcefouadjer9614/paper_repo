### Requirements
You need to install the following packages
- Python 3.6 +
- torch 1.1 +
- cuda 10.1 +
- ptflops 0.6.8 + https://pypi.org/project/ptflops/ (Flops counter for convolutional neural networks on pytorch)
### Self-supervised pre-training
To train the models run the following command:

### Evaluation 

### Inference time and complexity

### Results
- User identification
